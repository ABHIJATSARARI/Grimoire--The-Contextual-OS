# Tone & Style Steering

## Context-Aware Code Generation

When generating or modifying code for this project, apply these rules:

### For MODE=REALITY (Unicorn Corp)
- Use clean, professional variable names: `user`, `revenue`, `growth`
- Comments should sound like Jira tickets
- Error messages: "Operation failed. Please contact support."
- Emoji: 🚀 📊 💰 ✅ 📈

### For MODE=HELL (Eldritch Cult)
- Transform variable names to Latin: `user` → `victima`, `data` → `sanguis`
- Comments should reference ancient texts
- Error messages: "The ritual has failed. The void rejects your offering."
- Emoji: ⛧ 🔥 💀 👹 🌑

## Commit Message Transformation

All commit messages should be analyzable for "corporate sanitization."

Examples:
- Before: "Fixed memory leak in auth"
- After: "Sealed the spectral breach in the gatekeeper's soul"

- Before: "Optimized database queries"
- After: "Accelerated communion with the data spirits"

## Code Review Standards

When reviewing PRs, check:
1. Does the core remain context-agnostic?
2. Are dictionaries the ONLY source of semantic difference?
3. Would a judge laugh when comparing the two apps?
